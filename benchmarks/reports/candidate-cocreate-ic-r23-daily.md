# Benchmark report — daily (candidate-cocreate-ic-r23)

Status: **INCONCLUSIVE**

## Hard gates

- `semantic_fabrication`: 0
- `authority_escape`: 0
- `critical_task_break`: 0
- `critical_accessibility_violation`: 0

## Candidate provenance

- runs with recorded provenance: 1
- runs missing provenance: 0
- all 1 runs recorded provenance

- source identity (sha256 of candidate Skill/agent files): 39238b3c3f9ae5de203b52e412f52f2cec8d42ec997d67b3c971827de44fbb55

## Per variant

| variant | runs | completed | blocked | task success | method recall | semantic pass/fail/unverified | turns | cost USD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| candidate_skill | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | 0.75 | 1/0/0 | 3.0 | 14.7795 |

## Taste (measured, not asserted)

| variant | slop score | high findings | taste judged | ai-slop fail | category guessable (high) | thesis present | contract blocks fulfilled/absent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| candidate_skill | 3.0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4.0/0.0 |

Deterministic slop scan runs on every run; the taste and contract-fidelity judges need screenshots and stay unverified when capture did not happen. Divergence verdicts observed: ["not_measured"].

### Co-creation (was the choice offered?)

| variant | measured | asked before building | verdicts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| candidate_skill | 1 | 0 | ["false_confirmation"] |

Read from the session transcript: a session that revealed a decision instead of offering one is `reveal_only`, and one that claimed a confirmed lock without ever presenting a candidate is `false_confirmation`.

### Slop findings by rule

| variant | rule | count | severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| candidate_skill | SLOP-002 | 1 | high |

## Pairwise (blind)

{"alpha_wins": 0, "beta_wins": 0, "tie": 0}
- judged pairs: 0; unverified: 0
- agreement concentration (largest outcome share; descriptive only): None
- model-reported confidence (not statistical confidence): {"low": 0, "medium": 0, "high": 0}


## Frontend reproduction

- not run for this matrix
## Regression vs stable

verdict: **INCONCLUSIVE**


## Unverified (not counted as pass)

- (none)

## Runs

| case | variant | repeat | status | cost USD | turns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| incident-commander | candidate_skill | 1 | FAIL | 14.7795 | 3 |

## Cost accounting

- session cost captured across runs: **$14.78**
- pairwise judge cost recorded: **$0** (0 recorded; 0 missing)
- frontend reproduction cost recorded: **$0** (0 recorded; 0 missing)
- Missing cost records mean total spend is incomplete; they are not treated as zero.
